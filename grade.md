Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

### Responsive Design
- A number of sections are not responsive.
- There is a lot of inconsistency in the width and alignment of different section content. Ideally all sections should have the same width of container, and the same padding on the left and right, applied through the same `.container` class in each section, to ensure everything lines up perfectly.
  - there is no need to make different container classes for different sections. This leads to inconsistency

### Assignment Requirements
- A new Google font was not used.
  - You were supposed to change `Roboto` to a new font.
  - You included a variable for `--font-secondary: 'Merriweather', serif;` but did not link the font, so it does not work.
- All original colours from the assignments were supposed to be replaced with new colours
